![Kavya Vijay](/media/img-20190201-wa0026.jpg "Kavya Vijay")



There is nothing that you cannot accomplish if you put your heart and soul into it. Well, this is my attempt to accomplish Blogging. I am Kavya Vijay, a proud Law student, good books lover, a self proclaimed artist and a party freak. I have always been scared to put my opinions in words, mainly because there has been this strong fear of being judged, what if i am wrong. But my Law School helped me cope up with it. You know, a Lawyer should be opinionated and should be able to put her thoughts into strong minded words. That was my clue. After these four years of consistently writing assignments for college and for internship, I found a soothing effect that Writing had on me. It was a new feeling for me which made me realise why not start your own blog. Mostly it was my Brotherâ€™s idea, He has always appreciated my writing. While I was scared of my writing being simple, he pushed me into believing in it. So here I am trying to face my fear while doing something I believe in.



Hope you all enjoy this journey with me!
