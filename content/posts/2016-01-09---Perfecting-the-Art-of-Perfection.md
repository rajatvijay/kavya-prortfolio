  The importance of any KMP and Independent Director is not alien to any
  Business Executive. There are many failures and scandals, when analyzed show
  that the lack of check and balances on the functioning of them is one of the
  root causes of such effect. In Yes Bank, string of resignations of various
  members of the Bank without a clear reason for their exit rose questions about
  the inefficacy of the good governance rules and their many check-box
  declarations and evaluations. A good corporate citizen always find its way
  back, however, if it fails to comply with the principles of Corporate
  Governance, the consequence leads to its downfall, just like what Yes Bank is
  facing.

“Yes Bank loses more money in 3 months than PNB did in Nirav Modi's scam”- Business Today

“Yes Bank scam a case of corporate governance failure”- National Herald

“After ED, CBI to initiate probe in Yes Bank scam”- India Today

Through all these headlines and on perusal of various news articles, it can be pointed out and understood easily that Yes bank has committed fraud by misstating NPAs to the RBI, and is facing various corporate governance issues. But what is more significant is the series of events in relation to Independent Directors (“ID”) that have taken place in the past few years.

ID is a director of a Board of Directors who does not have a material or pecuniary relationship with the company or related persons, except sitting fees, that could affect the independence of his/her judgment. He represents the interest of various stakeholders while acting as a coach, guide, and mentor to the company. He is also supposed to bring an element of objectivity that is not confined to narrow corporate interests. The Companies Act, 2013 clearly imposes liability on the ID for any contravention of the law that takes place with his knowledge, this obligates the ID to initiate actions against any wrong that he becomes aware of. The knowledge could be obtained through meetings, discussions, etc and at times it could be through indirect methods, through agendas, etc.

\
In the past few years, many IDs of Yes Bank have resigned on various grounds. Mr. Rentela Chandrashekhar resigned because of the recent development in Corporate Governance that was not appropriate; Mr. Ashok Chawla resigned because of lack of time; Mr. Vasanth Gujarati also resigned, and recently Mr. Uttam Agarwal resigned because of the falling standards of Corporate Governance in the functioning of the Bank. However, it is to be noticed that the law governing IDs requires proper reasons for resigning but in most cases, the reasons cited are the paucity of time or other reasons. The string of resignations without a clear reason for their exit raises questions about the inefficacy of the good governance rules and their many check-box declarations and evaluations. The role of ID in a company is of utmost importance and requires to be fulfilled by utmost seriousness keeping in view the interests of stakeholders. These series of events throw light on how responsibilities of an ID and actions reflect the functioning of the respective Company.

The ID is on the Board to ensure that a company functions following proper guidelines and is complying with all the required regulations. The position highlights the independence present in a company regarding all the decisions that it takes. In Yes Bank case, if we look at the various IDs, we could see that Mr. Ashok Chawla’s name was mentioned in a charge sheet filed by the CBI for an offense that took place while he was the secretary of economic affairs in the Central Government, rendering him unfit to be on the Board of any Bank; and Mr. Vasanth Gujarati was alleged to be liable for fudged accounts. The question arises whether the background of an ID does not play an important role while deciding his position in a company or should it just be ignored?

Looking at various scandals and scams, there is a common practice followed, i.e, the resignation of the IDs. In the PMC scam, Jet Airways downfall, and others, the IDs have always resigned. Now, this shows that the degree of accountability for IDs is huge and that is why they resign even at the slightest hinge of risk. In the case of Yes Bank, the IDs were qualified with the right skills and knowledge but it should be considered by the candidates that the post should be occupied not on the basis of how lucrative it is but how well they can justify the position. When a crisis arises they should be able to deal with it and make sure that they are able to justify the position in protecting the interest of the stakeholders.

The key challenges faced by ID are aggressive reporting of accounting performance when a significant portion of executive compensation is linked to profits; excessive risk-taking by management to enhance performance in the short run, and uncalled for interference in management by the dominant shareholder.

The IDs were made mandatory to help a company function properly and for the benefit of its stakeholders while he monitors every action of the Company and prevents further frauds but the current scenario has made it difficult for them to achieve that level of independence and the seriousness required in justifying such an important position. For proper Corporate Governance, IDs need to be clear on Promoter intent, and to be free to work independently there should not be any conflict of interest, the law should be followed in its true spirit, and full independence should be exercised by the IDs.

Coming down to the Board of Directors and KMPs, Mr. Rana Kapoor, Ex CEO of the Yes Bank, was denied the further extension of his tenure with the Bank because of various fraudulent activities that RBI concluded about Yes bank’s functioning. Further, Mr. O.P. Datta, Former External Expert of Search and Selection, was an ID of Standard Chartered Bank while being onboard with Yes Bank. It should be noted that both the banks are rivals to each other and such an appointment should have been considered as a conflict of interest.

The functioning of Yes Bank came under scrutiny over regulatory and governance issues under Mr. Rana Kapoor’s watch in 2015. RBI found that :

1. Yes Bank consistently understated its NPAs. It turned out that the total NPAs diverged by the Yes Bank was₹3,277.
2. It also observed a very astounding deviation of₹978 crores for Net Profit.
3. Poor compliance culture and serious violations of statutory and regulatory guidelines.
4. Persistent governance and compliance failure.

Whenever Yes Bank tried to pull investment for the Bank, a new scam would pop up forcing the investors to step down from investing. Even though so many IDs and other members of the Bank resigned and RBI warnings, Yes Bank failed to come up with a solution to correct its mistakes. A bank’s stability is very important for the smooth functioning of a country’s economy as it sits at the heart of the economy. Therefore, it is very important that they function properly while making sure that their direct actions do not lead to the downfall of the bank and the economy. After the demise of Co-founder, Mr. Ashok Kapur, Yes Bank has faced major backlash. The flamboyant boy, Mr. Rana Kapoor has led to the downfall of the Bank which was once considered a figure of success in Private Banks. When Mr. Rana Kapoor was refused for an extension, it gave hope for the better future of the Bank, however along with him the head of the audit committee and a key external advisor also resigned, the leadership of Yes Bank was in turmoil and so was its future.Further, looking at the composition and members of various committees and Board, the members either had past criminal charges pressed against them or were incompetent for the position they held.

There have been so many laws and regulations formed for the better functioning of the company in past years. This is because the role of a KMP is dynamic and has to inculcate all the changes that take place. The existence of so many obligations and restrictions imply the importance of such positions. In Yes Bank, the former years of the bank boomed because of the dedication and seriousness it showed towards the work, however, in the last couple of years, it has become a perfect example of how management plays a crucial role in the development of a company and how important it is to be formed with utmost sincerity and the importance of corporate governance.

The importance of the Key Managerial Personnel is not alien to any business executive. The success of a company depends on the ethics, qualification, vision, and other qualitative features of a KMP. If they are the ones who forget the mission and vision of the business and focus on the monetary gains and lucrative benefits, the business is meant to doom. Corporate Governance is not rocket science but it is more complicated than it because while science tries to predict and control the behavior of one person, Corporate Governance tries to control and predict the behavior of a group of persons and in the same way the impact of such activities is on the public at large. Therefore, it is very important that every member of the Company has the right intention and abides by the principles of good corporate governance. The economy of various countries has seen downfalls throughout the past years because of persistent governance failures and poor compliance with regulations by companies. Therefore, keeping in view the series of various events that took place in Yes Bank and the way it has functioned, it is important for every company’s management to follow all the guidelines, comply with the law and make sure that the management is lead by competent and quality leaders that work independently, honestly and abide by all the principles.
